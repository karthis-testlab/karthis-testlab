### Hallo Amigos 👋

Quality always plays a major role in decides whether the business leads to the success (or) failure path.

Aristotle once said, “Quality is a Habit, it’s not an act”. Therefore providing a quality product (or) service once is not enough for an organisation. They should follow the standard quality practices, and deliver quality products (or) services consistently. 

And I am the person, one who ensure the quality of the product throughout the Software Development Life Cycle.
