### Hallo Amigos 👋

Quality always plays a major role in deciding whether the business leads to the success (or) failure path.

Aristotle once said, “Quality is a Habit, not an act”. Therefore providing a quality product (or) service once is not enough for an organisation. They should follow the standard quality practices and consistently deliver quality products (or) services. 

And I am the person, who ensures the quality of the product throughout the Software Development Life Cycle.
